Current development progress:

To Add:
* Total volume for the day
* Estimated feed amount
* Bottle amount
* Total fed amount for the day (feedAmount + bottleAmount)


Things to Resolve:
- Extracting dates for current day from DB using SQL queries doesn't work for localtime since it's stored as UTC
- Dealing with dates in JS not SQL
- 

Version 2.0:
* User Login
* Dynamic JS graphs
* Reminders to Feed/Express (push notifications not yet enabled in IOS12 (screw you apple) - can do via Chrome push notifications)
